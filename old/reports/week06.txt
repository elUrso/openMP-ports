    Refactor it in C or Rust or Lua 
    Generate more data to analyse
    Output to CSV
    Consider Rust as an exploration

REPORT

	Due to graduation, little results were achieved.

	The main progress was done on the knowledge side, studing about building systems.

	Was defined that the banchmark shall be adapted to run on bench, this means that it shall output BTS.

	To run a benchmark, just enter its folder and run bench build && bench run.

	The command export generate a csv line with the relevant data.

	So to test a set p with benchmarks q1 ... qn the user would do:

	cd p

	for i in * do
		BENCH_STDPATH=$i/ bench build && bench run && bench export >> $target;
	done;
