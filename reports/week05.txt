    -- Formalizaion of the Benchamark Table Format --

    After a meeting, some formal points were defined and the default data format is know JSON data.

    The JSONRecipe:

    {
        [device]: {
            id: String; /* XXXYYYY -> /X is the source and /Y is a control number; eg: DLL0746 */
            cpu: String;
            ram: String;
            gpu: String;
            os: String;
            model: String;
            notes: String;
        }
    }

    {
        group: {
            [bench]: {
                id: String; /* AAABBBB -> /A is the author  and /B is a control number; eg: VPS0176 */
                cmd: String;
                bin: String;
                args: String;
                runtime: String;
                hardware: String;
                runs: String;
                avg: String;
                dev: String;
                max: String;
                min: String;
                threads: String;
                avg_use: String; /* sum (nThreads x timeElapsed) / sum(timeElapsed)*/
                avg_thread_size: String;
                dev_thread_size: String; /* dev = sum((t-avg)Â²)/#t*/
                library: String;
                notes: String;
            }
        }
    }

    The folder for the data is ../results

    Port is not that promissive

    Look for benchmarks that do not focus on heavy matrix manipulations
